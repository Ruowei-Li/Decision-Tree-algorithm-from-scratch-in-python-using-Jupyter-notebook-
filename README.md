# Decision Tree algorithm from scratch in python using Jupyter notebook

This is an implementation of a full machine learning classifier based on decision trees (in python using Jupyter notebook). It uses the dataset [Mushroom Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) to train and evaluate the classifier. This dataset come from the [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). (Hint: There is missing values in this dataset, this algorithm ignores instances that have missing values.)

* It implements the Decision Tree algorithm with a train procedure. 

* It implements the information gain criterion.

* It implements tree depth control as a means of controlling the modelâ€™s complexity. In the procedure train I will implement takes a parameter stopping_depth. I will use the stopping_depth parameter to stop further splits of the tree. 

* It implements  a test procedure for the DecisionTree algorithm.
